# Class Register

This application is an easy to use console GUI for creating, editing and deleting students from a class register. 

I built this project to test my beginner knowledge in C++ in polymorphism, encapsulation and algorithms. I am currently learning C++ from Bjarne Stroustrup's 2013 *"C++ Programming Language"* and coding practices from Steve McConnell's *"Code Complete 2"*.

***WARNING:***
This is extremely basic and will be updated regularly! This is a simple testing ground for my current knowledge and contains bugs, incomplete code and more! I will be regularly be updating this as I learn new areas.
