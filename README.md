# Class Register

This application is an easy to use console GUI for creating, editing and deleting students from a class register. 

I built this project to test my beginner knowledge in C++ in polymorphism, encapsulation and algorithms. I am currently learning C++ from Bjarne Stroustrup's 2013 *"C++ Programming Language"*.
